## Mission objectives

- Be able to parse json files
- Be able to save json data into an SQL database
- Be able to design a relational SQL database
- Be able to visualize data from a SQL database
- Be able to deploy said database alongside (interactive) visualizations

## The Mission

Your games obsessed manager has a nice little side project for you: vizualize some interesting aspects about his poorly scraped [steam](https://store.steampowered.com) data. 
He's managed to compile a [json file](../../additional_resources/datasets/steam%20scrape/database.json) containing data on some 1000 odd games sold on the popular digital games storefront [steam](https://store.steampowered.com).

He'd like you to show him a proof of concept to translate data, visualize said data and deploy a little server so he can see if it is worth investing more time in.

### Must-have features

- json parsing to SQL data (you can use any number of layers in between, e.g. json > python objects > SQL data)
- any SQL database framework
- data retrieval from SQL database
- at least one visualization on the data
- deployment using docker+heroku

### Nice-to-haves

- a database having a relational structure, making use of primary keys, foreign keys,...
- interactive visualizations on the deployed site (e.g. genre filtering)
- timeseries visualizations
- gross/net revenu estimation using the [date-adjusted boxleiter method](https://vginsights.com/insights/article/how-to-estimate-steam-video-game-sales)
- at least one self datascraped game using steams [web-api](https://steamapi.xpaw.me/). Be careful about steam rate-limit! (no more than 200 calls every 5 minutes)

### Notes

This assignment comprises many different steps, and you'll work together on them with others. it is **essential** that you properly **decentralize the work effort**. discuss **interfaces** between your work and that of your colleagues.
Changes are pushed to **github**, with proper branches for new features. Ideally, any one member of your group can **understand** and **implement changes** into the source code without the help of teammates. Work cleanly and readable for the sake of your colleagues.
Your coach might look into your repository **before the deadline** to make sure that the structure is sufficiently **modular** for your group to work in tandem with each other. Use functions, and optionally OOP oriented programming to help in this effort.

You can use any web-application framework such as [dash](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/learn-build-dash-python) or [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Or any other tool to help you on your way.

You'd do well to use project management tools such as [trello](trello.com) to organize the project.

### Steps

These steps are suggested, not required

1. Design the pipeline for your MVP (read json > parse a single game > ... > vizualize data > ...)
2. parse the json and change it into a robust format to be turned into SQL data
3. Design a relational database
4. Store your data inside said database
5. write your web-app
6. make a docker image and contain your web-app
7. deploy your docker image to heroku alongside your database

remember that you are FIRST designing the MVP, so go through the whole process with only minimum requirements, afterwards you can refine your pipeline blocks.


## Deliverables

1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. **Discuss your finding in a section of your README.**
3. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
4. Your deployed webpage
